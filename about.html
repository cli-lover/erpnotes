        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Apeiron, a passionate developer who has been exploring Odoo ERP and its ecosystem. This blog is my way of documenting everything I learn along the way, from the basic concepts of Odoo to more advanced topics like building custom modules and integrating third-party apps.</p>
    
        <h2>Why I Started This Blog</h2>
        <p>While learning Odoo, I found that documenting my notes helped me understand the concepts better and allowed me to reference back to them easily. This blog was born out of that need. I hope it also helps others who are on their journey to mastering Odoo, whether you're a beginner or looking to dive deeper into its functionality.</p>
    
        <p>My goal is to break down complex concepts into easy-to-understand language and provide clear examples. I focus on explaining how Odoo works at a fundamental level while also showing how you can extend and customize it for various business needs.</p>
    
        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>On this blog, you can expect to find:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Step-by-step tutorials on building Odoo modules.</li>
            <li>Deep dives into the Odoo framework and architecture.</li>
            <li>Practical examples and coding tips.</li>
            <li>Notes from my personal experience learning Odoo.</li>
        </ul>
